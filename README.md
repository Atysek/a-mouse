# A-MOUSE
Custom-designed computer mouse by  myself using Blueprint Project from Hack Club.
The design was created in Onshape, a cloud-based CAD platform, making it easy to access, modify, and collaborate online.

# To fully use this mouse, you will need:
-A compatible mouse PCB
-Standard mouse internal components (sensor, switches, scroll wheel, etc.)
-The case
-Required fasteners and hardware for assembly

# 3D Model Files
The project is available in multiple formats for flexibility:
  .STEP – Universal CAD format for editing in most CAD software
  .STL – 3D-print-ready files (including the battery tab)

# FOLDERS
inventor - Full assembly and part files compatible with Autodesk Inventor
photo - Rendered images and previews
battery tab - Holder for battery

Print the case, screw screws, insert battery, plug the dongle in your PC and you're good to go!
